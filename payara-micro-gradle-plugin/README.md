## Plugin Tasks

### microBundle
This task bundles the attached project's artifact into uber jar with specified configurations.

- __javaPath__ (optional | default: "java"): Absolute path to the ```java``` executable.
- __payaraVersion__ (optional |  default: 5.193): By default ```microBundle``` task fetches payara-micro with version 5.193.

## microStart
This task start payara-micro with specified configurations.

- __useUberJar__ (optional | default: false): Use created uber-jar that resides in ```build\libs``` folder. The name of the jar artifact will be resolved automatically by evaluating its final name, artifact id and version. This configuration has the higher precedence (in given order) compared to ```payaraMicroAbsolutePath``` and ```payaraVersion```.
- __daemon__ (optional | default: false): Starts payara-micro in separate JVM process and continues with the gradle build.
- __immediateExit__ (optional | default: false): If payara-micro is executed in ```daemon``` mode, the executor thread will wait for the ready message before shutting down its process. By setting ```immediateExit``` to ```true``` you can skip this and instantly interrupt the executor thread. 
- __javaPath__ (optional | default: "java"): Absolute path to the ```java``` executable.
- __payaraMicroAbsolutePath__ (optional): Absolute path to payara-micro executable.
- __payaraVersion__ (optional): default: 5.193): The payara-micro version that will be used with ```microStart``` task.
- __deployWar__ (optional | default: false): If the attached project is of type WAR, it will automatically be deployed to payara-micro if ```deployWar``` is set to ```true```. 
- __javaCommandLineOptions__ (optional): Defines a list of command line options that will be passed to ```java``` executable. Command line options can either be defined as key-value pairs or just as list of values. key-value pairs will be formatted as ``key=value``.
- __commandLineOptions__ (optional): Defines a list of command line options that will be passed onto payara-micro. Command line options can either be defined as key,value pairs or just as list of keys or values separately.


## microStop
This task stops payara-micro with specified configurations. By default this goal tries to find out currently executing payara-micro instance based on project GAV. 

- __processId__ (optional): Process id of the running payara-micro instance.
- __useUberJar__ (optional | default: false): Use created uber-jar that resides in ```build\libs``` folder. The name of the jar artifact will be resolved automatically by evaluating its final name.
